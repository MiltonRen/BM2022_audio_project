Notes on Sculpture

milton: I'm heavily inspired by Alex Grey and his sculptures.

In particular, something similar to this (https://merranblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-08-at-13-02-34.jpg?w=590&h=635) would work very well and we can mount a solar panel perfectly on its flat top (the panel now doubles as a lid for us to access the internals).


Requirements:
- The shell should tolerate severe desert weather for up to 2 weeks, this includes:
  - severe heat during the day
  - coldness during the night
  - occasional heavy rain
  - dust, dust everywhere
  - strong wind
- Any shape is fine as long as top & bottom are squares.

Old brain dump:
- (OUTDATED!) There needs to be cutouts of various sizes for hardware installation:
  - front circular cutout of ~4 inch diameter (for the button)
  - top 6x6.4 inch rectangle cutout to mount a specific solar panel
  - back cutout & door to allow debugging / maintained
  - small cutouts for ventilation & sound & mic pickup (but we also need to be rain/storm-proof)
- (OUTDATED!) Able to mount onto the pole
  - mounting pole has 6 holes, 2.5 inches apart from each, see below:

O---O---O

Materials:
- I'm thinking about 3d printing a frame with PETG then build on top with various of materials. Not an expert in this area tho
